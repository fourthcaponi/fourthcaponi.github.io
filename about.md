Hello There!

### More Information

My name is Michael Caponi and I am a software engineer from St. Louis, Missouri.

In May of 2017 I graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with a degree in Computer Science. It was there that a certain professor introduced me to computer security. Since then, I have cultivated my passion for all things information and network security related. I earned my Security+ certification and am looking to use that as a stepping stone towards a career in computer security.
