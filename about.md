Hello there! 

My name is Michael Caponi and I am a software developer from St. Louis, Missouri. 

In May of 2017 I graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with a degree in Computer Science. It was there that a certain professor
introduced me to computer security. Since then, I have cultivated my passion for all things information and network security related. 
I am currently working towards a Security+ certification and would like to pursue a CISSP and eventually an OSCP certification. 

Outside of my profession, my favorite activity is either being active or being sedentary. Yes, I realize those are opposites. I am in the gym five days a week and
I am on a recreational softball team, but I also find time to play video games for a couple hours at a time so they balance out.

My website is using Jekyll and the theme is courtesy of [John Otander](http://johnotander.com).
