# My Personal Site

This website was built with a few different resources.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Bootstrap** makes it easier to create mobile-friendly websites. ([Get Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/))
